# Leukemia_Detection
Leukemia is the most common type of childhood cancer and accounts for approximately 25% of the pediatric cancers. It can be cured if it's detected at it's early stage. Here the job was to tackle one of the major childhood cancer types by creating a model to classify abnormal cell(leukemia cell) from normal cell images. We evaluated the results by building a CNN model from scratch and approaching a Transfer learning model to classify between two classes.
